The different output files have different formats. 
For values, warning, threshold 1, and threshold 2 each line represents the value at thecycle corresponding to the line number. 
For Rpeak and searchBack, each line is a cycle index where there was a peak.
In the file warning.txt the value 0 means "no warnings", 1 means "Rpeak value under 2000", 2 means "5 Rpeaks outside normal intervall",
and 3 means both "Rpeak value under 2000" and "5 Rpeaks outside normal intervall".
